## INSPIRATION

As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, gyms across the world were shut down. Without access to equipment and in person classes, most people were not getting enough exercise while under quarantine. It's hard to stay motivated when you're training alone. More often than not people tell themselves that they're going to workout and then donâ€™t actually do so, instead opting for a nap or a snack instead. With that, their activity level spirals download and their depression and anxiety increases. This was common at the peak of Covid-19. Because of this, I was inspired to create Bolt, an online running platform that includes online programs, many with live workout classes you can join on Zoom. This allows people to participate in classes whenever and whereever! 

## WHAT IT DOES

Bolt is an online platform that allows people of all ages to sign up for running lessons. Anyone can create an account and start discovering classes that are at their skill level, whether beginner or advance. You can filter by city to meet runners in your area. This allows a community to build and grow over time.

## WHAT'S NEXT

We plan to build out more features of our application including filters, search bars, progress bars, etc. and ultimately deploy the application to the Web. After doing so, we want to promote our platform to gyms across the area, so that we can grow our user base. Lastly, we will pitch our idea to leadership groups/sponsors so that we can expand our network and inspire more people to get off their couch and start running.
